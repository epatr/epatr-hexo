        <p>I grew up in Deland, FL and started programming when I was a teenager. I'm currently studying computer science at SJR State. In the early 2000s I began hosting house shows in Deland, FL, and I've been heavily involved with the DIY music scene ever since. Not a day has gone by when I wasn't in a band actively writing and performing original music. I fell in love with St. Augustine's extremely supportive music scene and moved here a few years ago. Fortunately, living in the nation's oldest city means there is plenty of old technology that needs refreshing!</p>
