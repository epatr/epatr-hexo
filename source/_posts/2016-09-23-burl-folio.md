The new issue of Folio Weekly is hot off the press today. This is a very special edition that is bound to become an instant collector's item, as the band I am in is mentioned in passing on page 34:

> My good buddy Alan Mills, who plays in Burl, will be playing guitar with us, too — there’s no way in hell we could recreate all the sounds from the album without him.

History in the making!
