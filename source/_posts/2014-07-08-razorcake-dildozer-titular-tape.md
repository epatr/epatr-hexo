Razorcake reviewed the Dildozer tape! It'll be in issue #79. You can <a href="http://www.razorcake.org/record-reviews/dildozer-the-titular-tape" target="_blank">check it out on their site</a>, but since it's short I'll just copy &amp; paste:
<blockquote>Decent smarty-pants punk rock from this St. Augustine, Florida-based trio. Having grown up in the area, I can relate to the “doin’ it for fun” vibe that is projected on this cassette. I get the feeling these guys are doing this for themselves and would happily play a show to three people at their local watering hole and they couldn’t care less. I have to confess that is a welcome feeling after sifting through releases from “professional” punk bands with endorsement deals and the like. To me, this is the sound of drinking a lukewarm twelve pack of Keystone Light with some of your closest buds and not giving a fuck. I’m not complaining.</blockquote>
Yep, that about sums us up! You can download it free from our <a href="https://dildozerfl.bandcamp.com/album/the-titular-tape" target="_blank">Bandcamp</a>.
