Welcome to my new blog, built by static-site generator [Hexo](http://hexo.io). I have been toying around with SSGs for a couple of years now, but I never found the time to fix all the idiosyncracies that seem to plague them. I really wanted to like Jekyll, but I'm a little burnt out on Liquid templates after working in Shopify all day! HexoJS is written in Node, which I already use daily, so I should be able to figure out how to get everything to my liking. 

Along with the move from Wordpress to an SSG, I'm also deploying my site to GitHub Pages and caching it aggressively with Cloudflare. It's even fully secured with SSL!
