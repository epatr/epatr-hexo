The Fall 2015 St. Augustine Record Fair is poised to be the largest event to-date, with over 50 tables of collectible vinyl records, CDs, memorabilia, posters, books, toys, and every other piece of music merchandise imaginable. 

NOTE: due to this event's expansion and ever-growing popularity, the event times have changed slightly, and the event location will be centralized in the pit-area in front of the main stage at the Amphitheatre.

26 dealers (some traveling as far as 500 miles) will be set up with table-after-table of music paraphernalia for sale - from highly-prized collectible LPs to cheap bargain bin finds, and everything in between. An estimated 50,000 items will be available for sale at this event, assuring a truly “something for everyone” shopping experience. 

In addition to plenty of music for sale, there will also be LIVE MUSIC from St. Augustine musicians Aslyn & the Naysayers, Burl, and Ghost Tropic, as well as Gainesville band UV-TV. 

Kids activities this time include a SCAVENGER HUNT which we have not done previously. And of course we will have the famous bounce house and face painting, too, as well as those awesome St. Augustine Record Fair LP jackets for kids of all ages to color in.

The following food-stuff purveyors will also be at the Record Fair: Kookaburra (coffee), The Hyppo (gourmet popsicles), The Vegan Hot Dog Cart (amazing dogs with amazing toppings) and Crave Food Truck (delicious wraps and more). We are working on a hot-food vendor as well, and possibly a local brewery who will be offering beer samples. Yes, this is shaping up to be the best record fair ever.

Several food trucks onsite, the St. Johns County Bookmobile, and multiple kids’ activities - including a bounce house, face painting, art projects, and an on-site scavenger hunt - will ensure that the entire family has fun at this free event!
